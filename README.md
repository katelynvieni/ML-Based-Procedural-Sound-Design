## CLAP Checkpoint
Download the CLAP checkpoint from:
https://huggingface.co/datasets/krvieni/ML-Based-Procedural-Sound-Design/resolve/main/music_audioset_epoch_15_esc_90.14.pt

Place the file in:
data/checkpoints/music_audioset_epoch_15_esc_90.14.pt

## CLAP Embeddings

Due to file size constraints, the CLAP audio embeddings generated for this project are hosted externally on Hugging Face, hosted at this link: 

https://huggingface.co/datasets/krvieni/ML-Based-Procedural-Sound-Design/resolve/main/embeddings.zip

The embeddings preserve the original folder structure used during processing. 

## K Means Predictions 

The predicted segments and output audio are hosted at this link:
